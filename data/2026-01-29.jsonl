Our quantum blackbody thermometer is based on measuring fluorescence ratios of optically excited rubidium atoms in microfabricated vapor cells. The key advantage of the quantum blackbody thermometer is that long-term stability of the fluorescence ratios is guaranteed by the immutable physical properties (transition strengths) of the rubidium atom. This should be compared against resistance-based thermometers, such as platinum resistance thermometers, which may be calibrated with exceptional accuracy but are susceptible to temporal drift and shifts due to improper handling."}

This failure stems from the artificial decoupling of energy modes, which ignores the exponential heating contributions from overpopulated high-lying states characteristic of Treanor-Gordiets distributions. We resolve this limitation by deriving a closed-form, thermodynamically consistent anharmonic gain function based on detailed balance and a second-order Dunham expansion. This formulation serves as a unified governing equation that naturally identifies the kinetic crossover between vibrational-vibrational (V-V) up-pumping and vibrational-translational (V-T) relaxation. This approach accurately predicts the Treanor minimum and recovers the accuracy of full state-to-state benchmarks at a fraction of the computational cost. The model provides a robust closure for predicting electron temperature evolution in applications ranging from hypersonic flows to plasma-assisted combustion."}

To minimize the inaccuracy of direct Wasserstein solver, we propose a two-stage pipeline that retains one-step efficiency while reinstating an explicit $W_2$ objective where it is tractable. In Stage I, a Meanflow-style regressor yields a deterministic, one-step global transport that moves particles close to their terminal states. In Stage II, we freeze this initializer and train a near-identity corrector (Deep Particle, DP) that directly minimizes a mini-batch $W_2$ objective using warm-started optimal transport couplings computed on the Meanflow outputs. Crucially, after the one-step transport (from Stage I) concentrating mass on the approximated correct support, the induced geometry stabilizes high-dimensional $W_2$ computation of the direct Wasserstein solver. We validate our construction in the 3D KS and KPP equations subject to fluid flows with ordered and chaotic streamlines."}

Computational prediction of this phenomenon is challenging due to the complex multiscale nature of blood. As a result, conventional approaches often fail to predict hemolysis accurately, commonly showing deviations of multiple orders of magnitude compared to experimental data. More accurate models are typically computationally expensive and thus impractical for real-world applications. This work aims to fill this gap by presenting accurate yet simple and efficient computational hemolysis models.\n  Methods: Hemolysis modeling relies on two key components: a red blood cell model and a hemoglobin release model. In this work, we compare three red blood cell models: a common stress-based model (Bludszuweit), a simple strain-based model based on the Kelvin-Voigt constitutive law, and a more complex tensor-based model (TTM). Further, we compare two hemoglobin release models: the widely used power-law approach and a biophysical pore formation model.\n  Results: We evaluate these models in two benchmark cases: the FDA blood pump and the FDA nozzle. In both benchmarks, the simple strain-based model combined with the pore formation model achieves absolute predictions of hemolysis within the standard deviation of experimental measurements. In contrast, stress-based power law models deviate by several orders of magnitude.\n  Conclusion: The strain-based pore modeling approach takes into account the biophysical properties of red blood cell membranes, in particular their viscoelastic deformation behavior and hemoglobin release through membrane pores. This leads to significantly improved hemolysis predictions in a framework that can easily be integrated into common CFD workflows."}

While ODT is well established for imaging thin, weakly scattering samples, it encounters significant challenges when applied to heterogeneous, strongly scattering thick samples such as tissues and organoids. In this work, a novel common-path interferometric approach to ODT is presented, specifically designed for the RI reconstruction of heterogeneous and highly scattering samples at high temporal stability. The proposed technique, termed lateral shearing (LS)-ODT, incorporates partial lateral shearing off-axis interferometry to suppress the effects of multiple scattering, similar to the mechanism in differential interference contrast (DIC) microscopy, which is widely used for imaging thick specimens. Additionally, the LS-ODT system uses dynamic speckle illumination to enhance both spatial phase and RI sensitivity compared to laser-based ODT systems. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through experiments on a cell phantom. Its robustness and accuracy are further validated across a wide range of samples, including mouse kidney tissue sections and brain organoids derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), in both thin and thick sections. Furthermore, correlative fluorescence and RI tomography of the organoids highlights the potential of LS-ODT to enhance and support a broad spectrum of biomedical studies, particularly in the field of histology."}

At magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) scales, compressible turbulence is damped by transit-time damping, naturally generating suprathermal electrons and proton beams. As the energy cascade reaches sub-ion scales, multiple branches of ion Bernstein waves are excited and contribute to the formation of proton suprathermal tails. Under realistic conditions such as those in the solar wind, these processes remain efficient and provide a natural explanation for the super-Alfvénic proton beams observed in situ. We show that compressive fluctuations, though often understudied, are essential for cross-scale energy transfer and dissipation in collisionless plasma turbulence."}

It is found that the the final flow type tends either to vortical flow or zonal flow, whose statistics are completely different. Notably, these two flow types frequently alternate as the time-step is reduced to a very small value, suggesting that the time-step corresponding to each turbulent flow type should be densely distributed. Thus, stochastic numerical noise exerts a huge influence on the final flow type and statistics of numerically simulated NS turbulence (i.e., turbulence governed by the NS equations) because the time-step has a close relationship with numerical noise. However, the NS equations, as a turbulence model per se, require all small stochastic disturbances for $t>0$ to be negligible. This leads to a logical paradox in the underlying theory. Further investigations are recommended to reveal the essential differences between the exact solution of NS turbulence, numerical simulations of such NS turbulence, and the corresponding actual turbulence. It should be emphasized that NS turbulence is closely related to the fourth Millennium problem, and turbulence is an unsolved fundamental problem in classic mechanics. Hopefully this paradox would be helpful to deepen our understandings about the turbulence and the fourth Millennium problem."}

Rather than introducing black-box source terms in the strong form of the governing equations, we augment the momentum equation directly in the variational (weak) form with parameterized bilinear operators. The coefficients of these operators are learned from high-resolution simulations so that unresolved small-scale dynamics can be represented on coarse grids. Applying the correction at the weak-form level aligns the learned model with the finite element discretization, preserving key numerical structure and better respecting the fundamental properties of incompressible flow. In the same setting, the approach yields solutions that are more accurate and more stable over long time horizons than comparable strong-form corrections. We implement the proposed method in the Firedrake finite element solver and evaluate it on benchmark problems, including the one-dimensional convection-diffusion equation and the two-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. End-to-end differentiable training is enabled by coupling PyTorch with the Firedrake adjoint framework. Across these tests, the learned variational operators improve long-term accuracy while reducing computational cost. Overall, our results suggest that weak-form learning provides a principled, structure-preserving route to accurate and stable coarse-grid simulations of incompressible flows."}

Although often termed a \"suction effect,\" its physical origin remains unclear, especially under unsteady flow, strong particle interactions, and transient force networks. Here we study suction-induced entrainment in a prototypical confined system using high-fidelity coupled CFD-DEM simulations resolving unsteady gas flow and discrete particle motion with moving boundaries. By decomposing the forces on individual particles, we show that suction is not purely pressure-driven, but results from the combined action of pressure-gradient and unsteady drag forces generated by boundary-accelerated flow. Despite the heterogeneous and transient force fields, the final entrained mass is found to be governed primarily by a single energetic measure: the mechanical work performed on the particle assembly in the entrainment direction during boundary motion, rather than by peak instantaneous forces. Varying boundary kinematics demonstrates that changes in displacement or velocity history control entrainment mainly by modifying the duration over which fluid-particle forces perform work. These results reveal an organizing principle for suction-driven entrainment and establish a work-based framework for boundary-induced particle transport in confined gas-particle systems."}

Aim: To provide an analysis of the inherent advantages and disadvantages of temporal sampling in scanning and wide-field microscopes and their effect on the fidelity of voltage spike detection. Approach: We develop a mathematical framework based on a mixture of analytical modeling and computer simulations with Monte-Carlo approaches. Results: Scanning microscopes outperform wide-field microscopes in low signal-to-noise conditions and when only a small subset of spikes needs to be detected. Wide-field microscopes outperform scanning microscopes when the measurement is temporally undersampled and a large fraction of the spikes needs to be detected. Both modalities converge in performance as sampling increases and the frame rate reaches the decay rate of the voltage indicator. Conclusions: Our work provides guidance for the selection of optimal temporal sampling parameters for voltage imaging. Most importantly it advises against using scanning voltage imaging microscopes at frame rates below 500 Hz."}

An XDL model based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) is used to identify and percolate high-importance structures for the evolution of the turbulent kinetic energy budget terms of a turbulent channel flow at a friction Reynolds number of $Re_τ= 125$. The results show that the important structures are predominantly located in the near-wall region and are more frequently associated with sweep-type events. In the viscous layer, the SHAP structures relevant for production and viscous diffusion are almost entirely contained within those relevant for dissipation, revealing a clear hierarchical organization of near-wall turbulence. In the outer layer, this hierarchical organization breaks down and only velocity-pressure-gradient correlation and turbulent transport SHAP structures remain, with a moderate spatial coincidence of approximately $60\\%$. Finally, we show that none of the coherent structures classically studied in turbulence are capable of representing the mechanisms behind the various terms of the turbulent kinetic energy budget throughout the channel. These results reveal dissipation as the dominant organizing mechanism of near-wall turbulence, constraining production and viscous diffusion within a single structural hierarchy that breaks down in the outer layer."}

The influence of these modes on free oscillation dynamics has been studied extensively; however, their role in droplet deformation, breakup, and fragmentation under impulsive acceleration remains largely unexplored. Here we systematically quantify how prescribed initial axisymmetric Rayleigh modes affect the deformation and breakup of an impulsively accelerated drop. Using experimentally validated, VOF-based multiphase direct numerical simulations, we isolate the coupled effects of finite-amplitude surface oscillation modes and the associated initial surface-energy state by initializing drops with well-defined $(n,0)$ modes (and phases) while conserving volume at finite amplitudes. We show that breakup is governed not simply by the initial drag of the imposed shape, but by the dynamic coupling between the free modal oscillations and the forced aerodynamic (or shear-driven) deformation: constructive superposition can strongly amplify deformation, whereas destructive superposition can stabilize the drop even under otherwise disruptive forcing. Across all systems studied, the outcome is controlled by how efficiently the external work is partitioned into recoverable oscillatory energy versus centre-of-mass translation and viscous dissipation, with viscosity and density ratio acting as key mediators that respectively damp modal interactions and restrict the time window for energy uptake."}

However, the experimental validation of robust inter-cell interactions in Moire photonic structures and the modulation of flatbands for specific photonic applications remain challenging. Here, we propose a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity and demonstrate nanolasers enabled by strong flatband coupling. In contrast to a twist-angle Moire cavity, a lattice-mismatch Moire cavity provides a stable flatband frequency and a substantial enhancement in Q factor compared to an isolated single-cell cavity, as the unit-cell size decreases. The photonic band-structure measurement of the small-unit-cell Moire cavity by photoluminescence reveals pronounced flatbands. Cell-resolved spectroscopy further confirms the presence of flatbands by identifying resonant peaks that consistently emerge across unit cells in a Moire cavity with a lattice mismatch of 102 nm, but not in a larger-unit-cell Moire cavity with a mismatch of 60 nm. Furthermore, mode selection is achieved by reducing the center-hole size, thus isolating the hexapole mode from the degenerate dipole modes while maintaining strong inter-cell coupling. Consequently, we demonstrate a low-threshold hexapole flatband laser in a single mode. Therefore, the systematic modification of the relative lattice parameters of the two constituent lattices offers a promising strategy for developing Moire nanolasers and flatband nanophotonic devices."}

Experiments are carried out in a wind tunnel, in which air is blown over a tank filled with silicone oil whose viscosity is fifty times higher than that of water. The free-stream turbulence is enhanced using upstream grids, achieving relative turbulence intensities up to 8%. Surface deformations are measured using Free-Surface Synthetic Schlieren with micrometer accuracy. Velocity measurements are performed using hot-wire anemometry above the interface and particle image velocimetry in the liquid. Results reveal two primary effects of grid-enhanced free-stream turbulence: an increase in the wrinkle amplitude, and a reduction in the critical wind speed at the onset of regular waves. Nevertheless, the wrinkle-wave transition still corresponds to an approximately constant friction velocity. Similar to a classical boundary layer over a flat plate, the friction velocity is found to decrease with fetch. From a wave energy balance, we develop a qualitative model explaining why, with the highly viscous liquid considered here, this decrease in the friction velocity results in a non-monotonic variation of the wave amplitude with the fetch."}

However, the high cost, limited scalability, and restricted substrate compatibility of epitaxial BTO films hinder its exploitation. Here, we demonstrate free-space optical modulators based on imprinted BTO metasurfaces with targeted designs for optical and electric field confinement within the active material. With resonances exhibiting high quality factors of up to 200, we demonstrate improved transmission modulation at sub-volt driving amplitudes and frequencies up to 5 MHz. Additional enhancement is achieved via ferroelectric domain alignment, resulting in up to 25 % higher modulation strength compared to the unbiased case and up to 75 % compared to previous demonstrations. This enhanced EO response, arising from the effective permittivity engineering and domain orientation in these polycrystalline metasurfaces, holds significant potential for scalable and efficient EO modulators and active metasurfaces."}

Using high-frequency long-duration experimental measurements, we extensively validate the gamma distribution as the appropriate probability density function of concentration, particularly at large scalar magnitudes. The two-parameter gamma distribution is shown to capture the PDF at all locations across the plume. The classical similarity of the mean and root-mean-square (RMS) concentration, often expressed through a Gaussian form, is recovered through similarity of the scale and shape parameters of the gamma distribution. In addition, statistics of extreme events, such as the 99th percentile of the instantaneous concentration signal, are also well predicted, and their observed invariance near the plume centreline is reasoned. Further, similarity is observed for the third- and higher-order central moments and standardised central moments from the experimental data. The framework of the gamma distribution is also analytically extended to higher-order statistics. The experimental data are in good agreement with the predicted central moments up to the eighth order. The results emphasise the importance of achieving statistical convergence for the intermittent concentration signal, directly influenced by finite sampling times in a measurement. A secondary result is obtained for the ratio of plume half-widths based on the mean and the RMS concentration to be $1/\\sqrt{2}$, consistent with experimental observations. The results establish the gamma distribution as a consistent and unified model for all scalar concentration statistics in elevated point source plumes within a turbulent boundary layer."}

By deriving the paraxial wave equation directly in the time domain from the Helmholtz equation under an adiabatic approximation, the model remains analytically tractable while extending paraxial optics beyond time-invariant backgrounds commonly treated by frequency-domain expansions. The resulting equation preserves a Schrödinger-like structure in the presence of explicit temporal modulation and admits closed-form solutions for ultrashort Gaussian pulses. The framework supports a Green's-function description and an operator-based Hamiltonian formalism, from which an ABCD matrix representation for temporal propagation in time-varying media is obtained. The results demonstrate that temporal modulation provides an active means to control ultrashort pulse dynamics, enabling tailored evolution of pulse characteristics such as temporal width and chirp, with potential applications in ultrafast pulse shaping and a direct connection to temporal wave-packet dynamics."}

Despite the strongly extensional and highly nonequilibrium nature of this motion, the jet exhibits simple and uniform rheological responses. To elucidate its extensional behavior in a highly extensional regime quantified by large Deborah and Reynolds numbers ($De \\approx 2.1 \\times 10^1 - 3.3 \\times 10^3$, $Re \\approx 2.8 \\times 10^1 - 4.6 \\times 10^2$), we use high-speed velocimetry and polarization-based stress imaging to measure the spatial distribution of velocity and stress throughout jets made of dilute polyethylene oxide (PEO) solutions. The bungee-jumper jets are found to exhibit two uniform characteristics despite the extreme $De$ conditions: a consistent spatial distribution of the extensional rate and a nearly uniform stress distribution during the jetting motion. These uniformities indicate that the seemingly complex jet dynamics can in fact be effectively represented using a constitutive model with spatially uniform coefficients. Comparison of several viscoelastic models shows that the Voigt model provides the best agreement with the measured dynamics, while the single-spring model captures the essential behavior when elasticity dominates."}

It bridges the microscopic world of molecular interactions with macroscopic sensing technologies, with applications in environmental sensing, defense and molecular diagnostics. However, current mid-IR cameras require cryogenic cooling and exhibit limited pixel resolution, high cost, and restricted spectral access. Optical up-conversion provides a pathway to overcome these limitations, but existing systems typically rely on narrowband phase matching, mechanical scanning, or angular tuning, limiting imaging speed and practicality. Here, we demonstrate the first single-shot, room-temperature multispectral mid-IR imaging of incoherent thermal light enabled by adiabatic sum-frequency conversion. Our system simultaneously converts the entire (2-5 ${μm}$) region into the visible domain, capturing the image on a Silicon detector with spatial resolution below 20 ${μm}$ and high angular tolerance. We validate full-field imaging using a USAF resolution target and demonstrate spectroscopic contrast imaging in dielectric metamaterials by resolving wavelength and polarization dependent scattering resonances, all achieved without scanning, thermal control, or cryogenic operation. This compact and robust approach bridges the gap between laboratory-grade infrared sensors and scalable Silicon-based detection technologies suitable for real-world deployment."}

While recent demonstrations of quantum nonlinear microscopy show sub-shot-limited sensitivity, they are intrinsically limited by availability of high peak-power squeezed light sources. Here, we introduce squeezing-enhanced photothermal (SEPT) microscopy, a quantum imaging technique that leverages twin-beam quantum correlations to detect absorption induced signals with unprecedented sensitivity. SEPT achieves 3.5 dB noise suppression beyond the standard quantum limit, enabling a 2.5-fold increase in imaging throughput or 31% reduction in pump power, while providing an unmatched versatility through the intrinsic compatibility between continuous-wave squeezing and photothermal modulation. We showcase SEPT applications by providing high-precision characterization of nanoparticles and revealing subcellular structures, such as cytochrome c, that remain undetectable under shot-noise-limited imaging. By combining label-free contrast, quantum-enhanced sensitivity, and compatibility with existing microscopy platforms, SEPT establishes a new paradigm for molecular absorption imaging with far-reaching implications in cellular biology, nanoscience, and materials characterization."}

The model, implemented using an artificial neural network, is trained on a direct numerical simulation database of compressible turbulent channel flows over rough walls. The dataset contains 372 cases spanning a wide range of irregular roughness topographies, including Gaussian and Weibull distributions, Mach numbers 0~3.3, and friction Reynolds numbers 180~2000. We employ an information-theoretic, dimensionless learning method to identify the inputs with the highest predictive power for the dimensionless wall friction and wall heat flux. Predictions are accompanied by a confidence score derived from a spectrally normalized neural Gaussian process, which quantifies uncertainty in regions that deviate from the training dataset. The model performance is first evaluated a-priori on 110 turbulent channel flow cases, yielding prediction errors below 4%. The model is assessed a-posteriori in wall-modeled large-eddy simulations across diverse test cases. These include over 160 subsonic and supersonic turbulent channel flows with rough walls, a transonic high-pressure turbine (HPT) blade with Gaussian roughness, a high-speed compression ramp with sandpaper roughness, and three hypersonic blunt bodies with sand-grain roughness. Results show that the proposed wall model typically achieves a-posteriori predictive accuracy within 10% for wall shear stress and within 15% for wall heat flux, with high confidence in the channel flows and HPT blade cases. In the rough-wall compression ramp and hypersonic blunt bodies, the model captures the heating augmentation with errors ranging 0%~20%. In the cases with the highest errors, the reduced performance is correctly detected by a drop in the confidence score."}

However, current PA imaging methods mainly explore optical absorption properties of biological tissue. To the best of our knowledge, tensile measurement based on PA effect is still an untapped area to be explored. In this work, we propose photoacoustic tensile imaging (PATI), a new PA imaging modality enabling quantitative assessment of tensile stress in biological samples. PATI exploits the nonlinear PA response induced by dual-pulse laser excitation to establish a mapping between the applied tension and the increment of the nonlinear PA signal. By varying the temporal delay between the heating and detecting laser pulses, the relationship between tensile force and nonlinear PA characteristics is quantitatively analyzed. Phantom experiments demonstrate a strong correlation between the nonlinear PA signal intensity and the applied tensile force. These results confirm the feasibility of the proposed approach for tensile force monitoring, which holds potential in biomedical applications, such as vascular pressure monitoring."}

Preprint", "summary": "We study fast and reliable generative transport for the 3D KS (Keller-Segel) and KPP (Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piskunov) equations in the presence of fluid flows with the goal to approximate the map between initial and terminal distributions for a range of physical parameters $σ$ under the Wasserstein metric. To minimize the inaccuracy of direct Wasserstein solver, we propose a two-stage pipeline that retains one-step efficiency while reinstating an explicit $W_2$ objective where it is tractable. In Stage I, a Meanflow-style regressor yields a deterministic, one-step global transport that moves particles close to their terminal states. In Stage II, we freeze this initializer and train a near-identity corrector (Deep Particle, DP) that directly minimizes a mini-batch $W_2$ objective using warm-started optimal transport couplings computed on the Meanflow outputs. Crucially, after the one-step transport (from Stage I) concentrating mass on the approximated correct support, the induced geometry stabilizes high-dimensional $W_2$ computation of the direct Wasserstein solver. We validate our construction in the 3D KS and KPP equations subject to fluid flows with ordered and chaotic streamlines."}
