It is typically acquired on-site from generators containing $^{99}$Mo, in turn produced at nuclear reactor facilities. This supply chain involves multiple points of vulnerability, which can lead to shortages and delays with potentially negative patient outcomes. We report on the development of a new family of cyclotrons originally designed for the IsoDAR neutrino experiment, capable of operating at much higher current than typical cyclotrons. When operated with deuterons at 1.5 MeV/amu and an anticipated continuous beam current of 5 mA, simulations project that such a system would yield $\\sim$10$^{13}$ neutrons per second using a thin beryllium target. This neutron yield is sufficient, in principle, to support $^{99}$Mo production without the use of highly enriched uranium or reliance on foreign reactors. Simulations and conceptual design studies suggest that the system's beam dynamics could make it a viable pathway toward decentralized, hospital-based isotope generation. The relatively low energy of the deuterons minimizes activation and safety concerns. This work presents the physics motivation, technical design considerations, and projected neutron yields, outlining a pathway from a neutrino-physics prototype to a biomedical isotope production platform."}

EODs based on potassium tantalate niobate (KTN) crystals feature some of the highest number of resolvable spots. These deflectors rely on internal electric fields generated by trapped electrons to enable beam scanning. However, visible light induces rapid photoionization of trapped charges, thus KTN-based deflectors are typically continuously recharged with a bias voltage that effectively limits the range of the deflector. Recent work has proposed the use of KTN-based EODs for biological imaging with infrared excitation light, but quantitative data on near-infrared photoionization is lacking. Here, we present quantitative measurements of photoionization in KTN deflectors across the NIR-I and NIR-IIa biological imaging windows (700 - 1300 nm), a range that is particularly important for deep tissue imaging and nonlinear microscopy. Using a two-beam polarization interferometer, we measured trapped charge density as a function of photon fluence. We observed that the photoionization rate decreases dramatically with increasing wavelength. The charge density decay curves exhibit multi-exponential behavior that cannot be explained by a single-trap model without recapture, indicating the presence of multiple trap species or substantial recapture. These measurements provide critical quantitative guidance for selecting operating wavelengths and charge-scan duty cycles for KTN-based EODs in near-infrared imaging applications."}

Instead of direct numerical interpolation, the kinetic equation is solved again when reconstructing the interfacial flux, in order to realize the coupling of phonon migration and scattering within a numerical time step. Specifically, the finite difference scheme is introduced and the second-order upwind or central schemes are used for the reconstruction of the interfacial distribution function and its spatial gradient. Consequently, the cell size and time step of the present method could be larger than the phonon mean free path and relaxation time in the limit of small Knudsen numbers.

Four analytical wake model combinations are assessed, employing different formulations for velocity deficit, added turbulence, wake superposition, and deflection, implemented in the LongSim software developed by DNV. The analysis focuses on time-averaged wake velocity deficits and turbine- and farm-level power output, with model accuracy quantified using mean absolute error metrics. The models reproduce general wake deficit trends and wake deflection across a range of atmospheric conditions, with normalised velocity deficit errors between 7% and 15%. Power prediction errors increase with farm depth, with turbine-level errors between 3% and 23% and farm-level errors between -13% and +30%. Some analytical models achieve accuracy comparable to reported LES results while requiring substantially lower computational cost.

A solution is offered by the blue-detuned MOT where sub-Doppler cooling dominates and the cloud is compressed. Several blue-detuned molecular MOTs have been implemented. A recent implementation relies on a pair of orthogonally polarized components whose frequency separation is smaller than the transition linewidth. We identify the trapping force in these MOTs. At a certain magnetic field, there is a state that is dark to the laser propagating in one direction, but not to the counter-propagating one. This Zeeman-induced dark state (ZIDS) sets up an imbalance in the photon scattering rate, leading to a restoring force. We also study the role of the moving lattices generated by the closely-spaced frequency components of the light. We show that there is a velocity-dependent force that drives the molecules towards the speeds of these moving lattices, and that over a relevant range of magnetic fields this combines with the ZIDS force to transport molecules towards the centre of the MOT. Here, gray molasses cooling, assisted by non-adiabatic transitions driven by the time-varying polarization of the light field, cools the molecules towards zero velocity. We study these mechanisms for model systems with simple level structures, then extend them to molecules with ground state hyperfine structure."}

The XPT geometry is obtained by combining a large strike point radius, similar to the Super-X divertor (SXD), with an additional X-point near the separatrix in the baffled outer divertor chambers and leads to additional exhaust benefits over the SXD. The broader electron density profile near the secondary X-point leads to additional plasma-neutral interactions, evidenced by a broader hydrogenic emission profile, and resulting in larger power and ion sinks. The increase in plasma-neutral interactions also leads to lower target electron temperatures and heat fluxes. These benefits appear to extend to transients, and preliminary evidence of improved ELM buffering in the XPT is presented.

The mechanisms behind such data-efficient learning remain unclear. Here, we propose a reinforcement learning framework in which an agent encodes continuous physical observation parameters into its state and is trained via episodic switching across closely related observations. With merely two or three observations, the agent acquires robust mechanics intuition that generalizes accurately over wide parameter ranges, substantially beyond the training data, as demonstrated on the brachistochrone and a large-deformation elastic plate. We explain this generalization through a unified theoretical view: it emerges when the learned value function enforces Bellman consistency across neighboring task parameters, rendering the Bellman residual stationary with respect to physical variations. This induces a smooth policy that captures a low-dimensional solution manifold underlying the continuum of tasks. Our work establishes episodic switching as a principled route to artificial mechanics intuition and offers a theoretical link to similar generalization abilities in biological learners."}

The underlying basis of this model was challenged by Nott~et~al.\\ [Phys. Fluids \\textbf{23}, 043304 (2011)] where the authors argued that the hydrodynamic contributions to the suspension stress should not appear in the particle-phase momentum balance, being replaced by a different particle-phase stress. The particle-phase stress proposed by Nott~et~al., while mathematically correct, involves the partitioning of the (non-pairwise-additive) hydrodynamic forces, and care is needed to understand how the force on a chosen particle is affected by a second particle. We show by a simple two-particle calculation what is the proper partitioning, and show that it is consistent thermodynamically and gives the correct equilibrium osmotic pressure of Brownian colloids. Using Stokesian Dyanmics suspension rheology, we quantitatively demonstrate that the hydrodynamic contribution to the suspension stress is virtually identical to particle-phase stress; the only difference is that the isolated single-particle hydrodynamic stress contribution -- the Einstein viscosity correction -- must be removed from the suspension stress when used to predict particle flux. Our results validate a key assumption of the SBM and therefore revive its physical foundation."}

Recent demonstrations of low-loss BaTiO$_3$ waveguides and high-Q resonators have established BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator as a promising platform for next-generation frequency-conversion and quantum photonic technologies. However, while BaTiO$_3$ electro-optic modulators are now well developed, nonlinear BaTiO$_3$ waveguide engineering remains comparatively immature. Techniques widely used in lithium niobate, such as periodic poling for quasi-phase-matching, are poorly suited to BaTiO$_3$ because epitaxial thin films exhibit high coercive fields, strong strain-clamping effects, multivariant domain structures, and slow, complex switching dynamics. These factors make accurate periodic poling challenging and hinder the development of efficient $X^{(2)}$ frequency converters. Here, we introduce a fabrication-robust alternative based on linear-nonlinear hybrid waveguides, where TiO$_2$ is selectively incorporated into BaTiO$_3$ ridge waveguides to enhance nonlinear mode overlap while relying solely on modal phase-matching. Using coupled-mode-theory simulations, we identify phase-matched geometries and show that the hybrid design achieves a 2.75x increase in normalized second harmonic generation efficiency over monolithic BaTiO$_3$ waveguides. The uniform, lithographically defined cross-section makes the approach highly scalable.

Traditional image-processing tools can identify bubbles only when they appear circular and isolated, but they struggle with irregularly shaped bubbles, shear-induced deformations, strong blurring, and partial overlaps. Multi-camera systems could overcome these issues, but require significant hardware additions and calibration effort. In this work, we introduce a new machine-learning framework that can detect bubbles and estimate their depth using only a single 20 kHz high-speed camera with 3 \\textmu m resolution. The method first uses a large unlabeled dataset and clusters the bubbles with an unsupervised algorithm to reveal their underlying structure. These clusters provide pseudo labels, which are combined with a small set of true in-plane bubble labels to train a semi-supervised model that generalizes across different bubble appearances. These components produce a continuous depth-proxy score that indicates how close each bubble is to the imaging plane, even when bubbles are distorted or irregularly shaped. In parallel, we perform robust bubble identification using instance segmentation, which separates touching, overlapping, and elongated bubbles generated by high-velocity shear. Quantitatively, the in-plane segmentation baseline achieves strong held-out performance with Average Precision (AP) = 0.818, implying stable detection across thresholds, clutter, bubble detection Precision of 0.901, and a False-Positive Rate (FPR) near 6.1\\%, hence low spurious bubbles and cleaner statistics under the tested acquisition conditions."}

Polariton canalization, exhibiting intrinsic collimation and diffractionless transport, emerges as a promising solution without guiding structures. However, earlier demonstrations have been restricted to certain crystal surfaces with intrinsic hyperbolic responses and operated in the linear regime. Here, we experimentally demonstrate canalization of nonlinear exciton polariton condensates with optical reconfigurability in a birefringent CsPbBr3 perovskite crystal without intrinsic hyperbolic response. By embedding the birefringent perovskite crystal into a planar microcavity, the interplay between cavity transverse-electric-transverse-magnetic splitting and crystalline birefringence produces an anisotropic band geometry with a hyperbolic-flat-parabolic evolution of polaritonic isofrequency contours (IFCs). Nonresonant pumping drives exciton polariton condensation onto flat far-field contours with nonlinear emission amplification, leading to coherent canalized flows with over twentyfold collimation with respect to arc-shaped contours. Reconfiguring the optical pumping-spot size allows switching the nonlinear polariton condensates into hyperbolic and parabolic IFC regimes, leading to divergent propagation behaviour with collimating reconfiguration. Our study reveals a distinct canalization framework for shaping the nonlinear exciton-polariton condensate flows, opening opportunities for all-optical polaritonic logic circuits based on stabilized nonlinear quantum interconnects."}

For fixed geometry with the radius ratio $η=0.5$ and over the Rayleigh number $Ra\\in[10^6,10^9]$, the heat transfer is strongest for ISOS, followed by INOS and INON, while ISON exhibits a pronounced suppression as a strong zonal flow aligned with the rotation develops. In the three cases dominated by large-scale circulation, the Nusselt number $Nu$ follows an effective classical-type scaling close to $Nu\\sim Ra^{0.27}$, whereas the zonal-flow branch displays a much weaker scaling $Nu\\sim Ra^{0.1}$ and strong flow anisotropy with the large difference between the radial and azimuthal Reynolds numbers $Re_r\\ll Re_\\varphi$.

The frequency of these interference peaks indicates the difference in path length between the stray light path and the nominal path.  To have a description of the measured data we realized optical simulations, which link the measured path length to a possible path throughout the system. In the following, we will show some measurements made on a test bench realized to simulate the performance of LISA interferometers and describe how accurate simulations are in predicting and explaining the measured results."}

Such TMS shows complex aerodynamic behavior in presence of geometric nonlinearity, not adequately studied in the past. The aerodynamic responses of anticlastic conical TMS under random wind loading is presented herein along with an equivalent static wind resistant design approach. The stochastic wind loading on the TMS in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) is simulated via the Large Eddy simulation (LES); which is detailed in a previous study by the authors and hence not repeated here. The aerodynamic loading is then employed as input in conducting the nonlinear time history analyses considering open (i.e. without facade) and closed (with facade) TMS, supported by peripheral/radial cables. The influence of the key parameters (aerodynamic roughness height, the rise-span ratio of the TMS and the membrane prestress, notably) are demonstrated. Although increasing prestress and rise-to-span ratio enhances the stiffness of TMS, the former shows dominance. Increasing roughness height also lead to increased peak loading/responses by enhanced turbulence. An equivalent static wind-resistant design is presented via the Gust Response Factors (GRFs) and an additional Nonlinear Adjustment Factors (NAFs). These factors are presented systematically, encompassing alternative scenarios. Multi-linear regression models are presented for predictive modeling of these factors, along with a probabilistic analysis for their design values that can be employed in practice bypassing an involved nonlinear dynamic analysis."}

The methyl radical, which is produced by $267\\,\\mathrm{nm}$ photodissociation of methyl iodide, is excited to high levels in its $ν_2$ ``umbrella\" vibrational mode by the dissociation. The ensuing coherent vibrational dynamics are observed by measuring ultrafast time-dependent changes in the x-ray transition energy from the C$1s$ to the singly-occupied valence orbital. Due to symmetry, the real space vibrational motion appears predominantly in the x-ray energy shift at the difference frequencies of the $ν_2$ progression, although the fundamental frequencies of the $ν_2$ mode are also observed. By constructing a fully quantum-mechanical model of the dynamics the coherent superposition is rigorously characterized and the real-space motion of the radicals is reconstructed. The retrieved trajectories are dominated by pronounced quantum beating governed by the high degree of coherent excitation and the strong negative anharmonicity of the $ν_2$ mode."}

Treating them as open-systems, we derive a time-local, completely positive master equation that retains non-secular interference between decay pathways and reduces to the standard secular description when the environment resolves polariton splitting. When it does not, the theory predicts order-one deviations from secular leakage dynamics, including bath-induced coherences and stabilization of dark polaritons, and provides a simple design criterion based on the ratio of polariton splitting to reservoir linewidth. A time-resolved leakage measurement, such as transmission, reflectivity, or photoluminescence, can be used to observe these effects."}

Conventional turbulence modeling approaches often struggle to capture the unsteady, coherent structures governing wake behavior, particularly for slender hydrofoils operating at high Reynolds numbers. This study addresses this limitation by combining scale-resolving numerical simulations, including high-resolution Large Eddy Simulation (LES), with Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) measurements to investigate the turbulent wake of a symmetric, blunt trailing-edge hydrofoil operating at zero angle of attack. The flow was analyzed at a Reynolds number of approximately 7.5x10e5, i.e. close to the onset of wake-structure interaction effects. LES was performed using a fine mesh of approximately 500 million nodes to resolve near-wall and wake dynamics beyond the experimental field of view, while PIV measurements provided time-resolved velocity fields downstream of the trailing edge. Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) was applied to the PIV data to extract dominant coherent structures and quantify their contribution to the turbulent kinetic energy. POD analysis reveals that energy is distributed across many modes, with the leading mode capturing the primary wake dynamics and higher modes forming coupled oscillatory pairs associated with von Karman vortex shedding. PIV-LES agreement shows that central wake measurements combined with numerical simulations enables full wake reconstruction and validates modeling for vibration-relevant hydrofoil dynamics."}

We show that these reverse energy flows, observed in both transmitted and reflected fields, originate from vortex structures in the Poynting vector. The resulting energy-flow patterns exhibit striking analogies to vortex formation in fluid motion past obstacles. The geometry and dynamics of the Poynting-vector vortices determine whether the incident electromagnetic energy is impeded, leading to the formation of photonic band gaps, or instead guided through the structure, enabling transmission."}

Here, we extend this dynamical systems approach to spatially extended turbulent flows featuring multiple interacting 'substructures', and show how new simple invariant solutions can be constructed by spatial tiling of exact solutions from small-box calculations. Candidate solutions are found via gradient-based optimization of a scalar loss function which targets autorecurrence in spatially-masked regions of the flow. We apply these ideas to a vertically-extended Kolmogorov flow, where we first identify large numbers of relative periodic orbits (RPOs) which are combinations of high-dissipation, small-box solutions with laminar patches. We then show that vertically-stacked combinations of pairs of distinct small-box RPOs can form robust guesses for dynamically-relevant two-tori in the larger domain. Finally, we show how our optimization procedure can identify 'turbulent' trajectories which locally shadow a small-box RPO for multiple periods in a subdomain. These small-box combinations are possible as the flow spends prolonged periods in a regime where it can be effectively considered as a pair of weakly-coupled small-box systems, due to shielding effects associated with higher-dissipation flow structures."}

The large modal overlap near an EP intensifies gain competition, favoring single-mode lasing. Recent studies further revealed self-modulation closer to the EP that transforms the lasing mode into a frequency comb. Such EP-enabled comb formation suggests a previously unaccounted-for mechanism that overcomes the strong gain competition and drives a second mode to threshold. Here, using a Bloch coupled-mode theory derived from first principles, we show that the second threshold arises from dynamical couplings among the population inversion, the lasing field, and a dark cavity mode. The lasing-inversion coupling produces extra EPs, whose spectral structure governs switching among single-mode lasing and frequency combs with different repetition rates. This above-threshold mode-switching mechanism enables new opportunities for tunable photonic systems, including adaptive optical communication links and dual-comb spectroscopy."}

While generative AI offers a promising avenue for surrogate modeling, standard video generation architectures lack the specific control and data compatibility required for physical simulations. This paper introduces a geometry aware world model architecture, derived from a video generation architecture (LongVideoGAN), designed to learn transient physics. We introduce two key architecture elements: (1) a twofold conditioning mechanism incorporating global physical parameters and local geometric masks, and (2) an architectural adaptation to support arbitrary channel dimensions, moving beyond standard RGB constraints. We evaluate this approach on a 2D transient computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problem involving convective heat transfer from buoyancy-driven flow coupled to a heat flow in a solid structure. We demonstrate that the conditioned model successfully reproduces complex temporal dynamics and spatial correlations of the training data. Furthermore, we assess the model's generalization capabilities on unseen geometric configurations, highlighting both its potential for controlled simulation synthesis and current limitations in spatial precision for out-of-distribution samples."}

Despite its wide adoption in commercial systems, its bandwidth for SHG is fundamentally limited by the quasi-phase matching condition. This can be overcome by aperiodic or chirped PPLN structures; however, such devices are typically custom-fabricated and not readily available commercially. In this study, we investigate an alternative approach to achieving broadband SHG by using a standard PPLN crystal containing multiple fixed poling periods. Broadband operation is realized by angle tuning the crystal relative to input beam in free-space. The effect of angle tuning is examined over a range of incident angles, and an 1.6x enhancement in SHG bandwidth is demonstrated. These results suggest a practical and efficient strategy for broadband SHG using standard PPLN devices."}
