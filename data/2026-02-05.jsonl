It is known that for a constant collision coefficient $ν$, the solution to the Cauchy problem for such a system can lose smoothness. However, if the dependence of $ν$ on the electron density $N$ is more than linear, then the solution remains globally smooth for any initial data. However, the appearance of the dependence $ν(N)$ leads to a change in the type of the system, it loses hyperbolicity, which leads to computational problems. In this paper, we propose a new implicit solution method in Euler variables that overcomes these difficulties.

Here, we uncover a fundamental ubiquity in the stochastic dynamics of double well energy systems when initialized near the barrier top. Using a topological framework grounded in Morse theory and singularity theory, we make use of the result that all smooth, even double well potentials reduce near the saddle point to a canonical quartic normal form. Within this regime, the interplay of noise, synaptic bias, and potential curvature produces a topologically robust short time evolution characterized by a tanh like response. This enables Boltzmann like sampling that is largely independent of the detailed shape of the potential, apart from its effective temperature scaling. Analytical derivations and numerical simulations across multiple representative systems corroborate this behavior. Our work provides a unifying foundation for assessing and engineering a broad class of physical platforms, including oscillators, bistable latches, and magnetic devices, as p-bits operating within a synchronous framework for stochastic sampling and probabilistic computation."}

Instead of enlarging the physical aperture, they rely on strongly coupled currents, near-field energy storage, and controlled modal interference so that a compact structure radiates with enhanced directivity. This review emphasizes link-relevant evaluation and reporting: realized gain referenced to a stated impedance plane, clearly stated bandwidth definitions (impedance and performance), and robustness to fabrication spread and platform/environmental loading. Two practical implementation routes are surveyed. The first uses resonant, tightly coupled arrays, including fully driven arrays and single-chain designs based on parasitic or reactively loaded elements. The second uses single-body radiators that enforce a targeted mixture of multipoles or resonant/characteristic modes with one or a few feeds, including symmetry-broken dielectric resonators and mixed electric--magnetic designs. Across RF, microwave, and optical regimes, the same penalties recur as superdirectivity is pushed: reduced radiation resistance, rapid impedance variation, narrow usable bandwidth, and strong sensitivity to small perturbations. Beyond geometric synthesis and multi-resonant stacking, the review highlights emerging levers that can shift these trade-offs in specific system contexts: low-loss materials and cryogenic operation to improve efficiency and frequency stability, and time-varying loading and matching (Floquet/parametric approaches) that can relax linear time-invariant bandwidth constraints, at the cost of added control complexity and spectral conversion."}

Starting from the streamwise momentum equation, we derive exact integral equations that relate the square plane-average and the square fluctuating WSS to wall-normal integrals of terms combining shear with acceleration, shear with pressure-radient, and shear with viscous diffusion. The square plane-average WSS can be well approximated by the product of plane-average shear and plane-average acceleration integrated over the buffer layer with corrections from the mean pressure gradient which diminish as the reciprocal of the Reynolds number. The square fluctuating WSS is similarly well approximated by the shear-acceleration and shear-pressure-gradient covariances integrated over the buffer layer, but the latter increases in magnitude with Reynolds number and is therefore not negligible. The acceleration fluctuations around the plane-average acceleration consist of a local Eulerian fluctuating acceleration, an advective acceleration and a term which gives rise a turbulence production contribution to the shear-acceleration covariance. By Taylor's frozen turbulence hypothesis the Eulerian acceleration and the streamwise mean advection part of the advective acceleration cancel each other. The shear-acceleration covariance is characterised by a near-wall peak which results from turbulence production and, more specifically, sweeps."}

Yet standard impedance/scattering tools and weak-loss resonator approximations do not provide low-dimensional invariants that remain predictive under intrinsic asymmetry and realistic boundaries, nor do they cleanly separate total absorption from useful power delivered to a load. Here we develop a unified mass--energy framework for linear, single-mode, one-dimensional systems, in which energy-like and power-flow variables $(\\mathcal{U},\\mathcal{S})$ satisfy the universal invariant $\\mathcal{U}^2-\\mathcal{S}^2=|Γ_g|^2$, with the effective standing-wave ``mass'' $|Γ_g|$ becoming state-dependent under asymmetry. The Cai--Smith chart gives a bounded state-space map of stability, feedback proximity and operating states, and makes explicit the divergence between maximum absorption and useful delivery under loss. We derive four laws governing absorption and emission, validate the invariant in multiport optics via coherent perfect absorption at exceptional points using a basis-independent SVD criterion (reconciling quadratic vs quartic near-zero scaling), and map electrochemical polarization onto the same geometry by extracting $|Γ_g|$ from two-mode orthogonal fits to reveal a universal storage-to-transfer transition across pH.

The influence of charging dynamics is explored using an enhanced one-dimensional fluid-Poisson model, where the source charge is treated as a dynamical variable and solved self-consistently alongside the core plasma equations. By comparing these results with prior fixed-charge models, we evaluate the effects on soliton onset and propagation, finding that charging dynamics does not hinder soliton generation or evolution. To assess the impact of the impermeability of debris surface, a two-dimensional fluid model simulates the interaction between an electrostatically biased, impenetrable object and a flowing plasma. Modeling the object as an infinite wall disconnects the upstream and downstream plasma regions, forming a sheath without solitons -- consistent with earlier fluid and particle-in-cell simulations. However, replacing the wall with a finite object enables plasma flow around it, restoring upstream-downstream connectivity and naturally generating precursor solitons."}

However, most PINNs developed for fluid dynamics remain restricted to fixed flow parameters, requiring retraining for each new condition and limiting their usefulness as general purpose solvers. In this work, we develop a parameterized PINNs formulation for the incompressible Navier Stokes equations in which the Reynolds number (Re) is treated as an explicit network input, enabling a single trained model to represent a continuous family of flow solutions. The approach is demonstrated using the 2D lid driven cavity flow as a canonical benchmark. For low Re, where the flow is laminar and diffusion dominated, pure PINNs trained solely using the governing equations and boundary conditions accurately reproduce velocity and pressure fields across a wide range of Re, including cases not explicitly sampled during training. As the Re increases and the flow becomes increasingly convection dominated, the predictive accuracy of pure PINNs deteriorates due to stiffness and optimization imbalance. To address this limitation, a hybrid framework is introduced that combines transfer learning with sparse supervision from high fidelity CFD data. The resulting parameterized PINNs model accurately captures the Re dependence of the flow over both interpolation and limited extrapolation regimes while requiring CFD data only over a narrow subset of the parameter space. Detailed comparisons with OpenFOAM simulations demonstrate strong agreement in velocity profiles, and pressure fields. The results show that incorporating governing parameters directly into PINNs enables the construction of parametric Navier Stokes solvers, offering a promising route toward efficient reduced order modeling and data assisted simulation of fluid flows."}

Here, we report a purely geometric scheme for achieving massive equipartition of coherent light on a photonic chip by leveraging the geometric phases of a null space spanned by degenerate states with zero eigenvalue. The evolution of the null space maps to real-space rotation described by the special orthogonal group SO(N), thus enabling precise and scalable control over light distribution by engineering the system parameters. We experimentally realize up to one-to-nine equipartition of light on a waveguide array fabricated on a glass-based photonic chip. The framework can be upscaled for one-to-N light distribution.

This approach provides a computationally efficient path to modeling complex transport problems. We apply this framework to the canonical problem of test particle drag in a uniform plasma. The GLE formalism is shown to naturally capture non-Markovian phenomena through the moments of the kernel, including an effective mass renormalization and oscillatory relaxation. We demonstrate that the standard Chandrasekhar stopping power formula arises naturally as the Markovian limit of this equilibrium memory kernel. These theoretical predictions are quantitatively validated by direct Particle-in-Cell simulations, which confirm the predicted oscillatory structure of the memory kernel. This work thus establishes a practical method for predicting non-equilibrium transport properties from first-principles equilibrium simulations."}

Here, we demonstrate that optical topologies in the form of skyrmions are highly resilient to the effects of real-world atmospheric turbulence. We create and transmit these particle-like topologies of light through a 270~m free-space optical link, revealing their robustness across a wide variety of conditions and turbulence strengths. While we observe severe distortion in the states' underlying degrees of freedom, we show that the topological numbers are preserved in all cases. We account for fast changes to the medium, where the channel produces statistically averaged outcomes, by probing the state's decoherence, showing that while the degree of polarisation consequently decays, the topology remains intact. Using topology, we show information can be transmitted through the channel with almost perfect fidelity (>98%) in most cases, only decreasing to 86% in the most severe conditions tested.

The setup excites the sample with a laser and acquires a spectrum at each spatial coordinate in a raster scan pattern. A double-acquisition method is used to remove cosmic ray artifacts by comparing subsequent measurements at the same spatial coordinate. Once identified, the emitter is further characterized via a HBT setup, thereby measuring lifetime as well as second-order autocorrelation g(2) measurements to confirm singlephoton emission. The system integrates Python-based hardware control for motorized stages, spectrometer acquisition, and post-processing, with a migration to a galvo-mirror scanning approach for using it along with a cryostat for low temperature measurements. Our results demonstrate spatially resolved PL maps and temperature-dependent spectra, highlighting the capability of the setup to efficiently benchmark SPE performance. We further went on to perform automation of other experiments such as a Non-Linear Interferometry setup for Quantum Imaging with Undetected Light and a Fourier Transform Imaging Spectroscopy using a common path birefringence Interferometer to obtain hyperspectral images of our samples."}

Two DHM prototypes were developed; an initial lens-based system serving as the foundation for algorithm development, and experimental validation of the approach, achieving 89.6% classification accuracy on a 3-part differential, and a subsequent lensless system for simplified design and increased field-of-view (FoV). Both prototypes employed convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for cell classification. With further optimizations, the lensless system achieved classification accuracies of 92.65% and 89.44% on the 3-part and 5-part differential, respectively. With the lensless system, the derivation of the monocyte distribution width (MDW), a biomarker for sepsis, was also demonstrated.\n  Additionally, pixel super-resolution and multi-wavelength DHM approaches were investigated to enhance the obtained cell information. Finally, a proof-of-principle physics-informed neural network (PINN) for holographic reconstruction was implemented, demonstrating the potential for machine learning (ML) reconstruction techniques.\n  In summary, this work represents an initial exploration of DHM for dWBC in PoC devices, laying the groundwork for future research."}

However, several ultra stable laser systems observed additional noise sources that hinder the realization of the expected improvements in frequency stability. These additional noise sources are related to the birefringence of the coatings and its modification by intracavity light. The origin of the birefringence is not yet well understood and its modification via illumination remains unexplained. Here we present an extensive study on the steady-state and transient modification of the birefringence by intracavity light and by uniform illumination at various wavelengths using an optical cavity at room temperature. We find a unified description that suggests a primary two-photon process for photon energies below the bandgap of GaAs, or a single-photon process at higher energies. Adding external illumination allows to reduce noise induced by laser power fluctuations by balancing the photo-thermal-optic response of the mirrors and the photo-birefringent effect at a more favorable low intracavity power."}

However, these imagers generally suffer from poor reconstruction quality. Here, we describe several advances in both hardware and software that result in improved lensless imaging quality. First, we use a precision-manufactured random multi-focal lenslet (RML) phase mask to produce improved measurements with reduced multiplexing. Next, we implement a ConvNeXt-based reconstruction architecture, which provides up to 6.68 dB improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio over state-of-the-art attention-based architectures. Finally, we establish a parallel imaging setup that simultaneously images a scene with RML, diffuser and lens systems, with which we collect datasets with 100,000 measurements for each system, to be used for reconstruction model training and evaluation. Using this standardized system, we quantify the improved measurement quality of the RML compared to a diffuser using the modulation transfer function and mutual information. Our ConvRML system benefits from both the optical and the computational developments presented in this work, and our contributions establish resources to support continued development of high-quality, compact, and compressive lensless imagers."}
