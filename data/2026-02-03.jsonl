Here, we presented an ingenious hexagonal nanowire (HNW)-based PSC that achieves broadband absorption, minimizes reflectance, and offers robust polarization insensitivity by improving light-matter interaction and increasing charge-collection efficiency. The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport. The optimized HNW structure achieved a notable power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, highlighting a strong connection between optical confinement and effective carrier transport. These attributes render the proposed HNW PSC a viable option for high-performance PV systems and scalable thin-film solar technologies."}

In this numerical study, we examine fluid transport driven by the active beating of a single filament immersed in a three-dimensional two-phase flow. The cilium is modeled as an elastic filament actuated by a time-varying basal angle. The two-phase flow is resolved using the Shan-Chen model in a lattice Boltzmann solver, while the two-way coupling between the filament and the fluid is treated by the immersed boundary method. Pathological conditions such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are associated with drastic alterations of MCC properties, including changes in periciliary layer (PCL) thickness and the viscosity ratio between the PCL and the mucus layer (ML). Here, we systematically investigate the effects of these parameters, along with filament bending stiffness, on the beating pattern and fluid transport. Within the parameter ranges investigated, a moderate PCL thickness and viscosity ratio, together with high bending stiffness, tend to yield higher net flow rate and transport efficiency. The underlying hydrodynamic mechanisms are characterized through analyses of the beating pattern, filament dynamics, energy partition, and flow-field evolution. Two competing mechanisms are identified: the drag-elastic force balance and the viscous diffusion of momentum. Furthermore, quantitative relationships are established between flow rate and beating pattern, expressed in terms of tip amplitude and beating asymmetry."}

Neuromorphic networks, with structures inspired by the brain's architecture, offer a compelling solution with the potential to approach the extreme energy efficiency of neurobiological systems. Photonic neuromorphic networks (PNNs) are particularly attractive because they leverage the inherent advantages of light, namely high parallelism, low latency, and exceptional energy efficiency. Previous PNN demonstrations have largely focused on device-level functionalities or system-level implementations reliant on supervised learning and inefficient optical-electrical-optical (OEO) conversions. Here, we introduce a purely photonic deep PNN architecture that enables online, unsupervised learning. We propose a local feedback mechanism operating entirely in the optical domain that implements a Hebbian learning rule using non-volatile phase-change material synapses. We experimentally demonstrate this approach on a non-trivial letter recognition task using a commercially available fiber-optic platform and achieve a 100 percent recognition rate, showcasing an all-optical solution for efficient, real-time information processing.

This dataset is used to derive a regression scaling expression based solely on engineering parameters, and the results are compared to predictions from the two-point model. The agreement found is remarkable: both the regression and model provide similar parameter dependencies and tokamak-specific multiplicative constants. Building on this agreement, a fully predictive formula that combines the regression dependencies and the two-point model multiplicative constant is proposed. This formula is able to estimate $n_{e,\\mathrm{sep}}$ across the three machines within a factor of 1.5, and provides projections to next-step devices (ITER, SPARC, DTT, JT-60SA and COMPASS-U) that are in agreement with available SOLPS simulations."}

Transverse and longitudinal deformations can propagate on this rivulet, although both are linearly attenuated in the parameter range we use. On this seemingly simple system, we impose an external acoustic forcing, homogeneous in space and harmonic in time. When the forcing amplitude exceeds a given threshold, the rivulet responds nonlinearly, adopting a peculiar pattern. We investigate the dance of the rivulet both experimentally using spatiotemporal measurements, and theoretically using a model based on depth-averaged Navier-Stokes equations. The instability is due to a three-wave resonant interaction between waves along the rivulet, the resonance condition fixing the pattern wavelength. Although the forcing is additive, the amplification of transverse and longitudinal waves is effectively parametric, being mediated by the linear response of the system to the homogeneous forcing. Our model successfully explains the mode selection and phase-locking between the waves, it notably allows us to predict the frequency dependence of the instability threshold. The dominant spatiotemporal features of the generated pattern are understood through a multiple-scale analysis."}

We show that inelastic scattering amplitudes are governed by overlap integrals between static modes at the input and output frequencies. Using this insight, we analyze scattering from a time-modulated, isotropic, dielectric sphere and a high-permittivity dielectric cylinder, and demonstrate how modal orthogonality can suppress inelastic channels, while appropriate tuning of geometric parameters can significantly enhance them. In particular, we show that cylindrical resonators support strong inelastic scattering when resonance-to-resonance optical transitions, induced by the temporal variation, involve a high-Q supercavity mode.

In materials with nonzero second-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(2)}$, SFWM can generate photon pairs both directly, through the third-order nonlinear susceptibility $χ^{(3)}$, and in a cascaded way, through second harmonic generation (SHG) followed by SPDC. Usually, the cascaded process is more efficient. Here, we show that in a thin layer, direct SFWM dominates, because the wavevector mismatch for SFWM is much smaller than for SHG or SPDC. To demonstrate it, we implement the photon pair generation via SFWM in a second-order nonlinear material - a thin layer of lithium niobate (LN).

The rotational symmetry of the HNW configuration yielded polarization-independent absorbance under both TE and TM illumination across the visible and near-infrared spectra. The optimization of the geometrical parameters of CH3NH3PbI3-based HNW structure, including diameter, period, and fill ratio, offered a wide rangeof variations that influenced both optical properties and device performance. To further intensify photon confinement, a dielectric SiO2 sphere is partially embedded in the ITO layer, improving long-wavelength absorbance and increasing electron-hole pair generation near the active region. We analyzed the finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method to examine the optical properties of our proposed structure. This study demonstrates that our proposed structure has achieved a higher generation rate, enhanced absorbance, and a higher optical short-circuit current density (Jsc) of 29.53 mA/cm2. Electrical performance is assessed by solving the coupled drift-diffusion and Poisson equations for the dynamics of carrier transport. The optimized HNW structure achieved a notable power conversion efficiency of 24.2%, highlighting a strong connection between optical confinement and effective carrier transport. These attributes render the proposed HNW PSC a viable option for high-performance PV systems and scalable thin-film solar technologies."}

This is a regime of high experimental relevance which has not been described in full detail. The experiments are complemented with the analytical formulas explaining the field scattered directed toward the backward hemispace. In particular, it is proven that this field shows a very regular oscillatory dependency with the optical size. This phenomenon is typically hidden in the total scattered field, as the field is scattered much less toward the backward hemisphere than toward the forward one. These regular oscillations are measured experimentally. It is proven that, by analyzing them, it is possible to determine the index of refraction of isolated micron_sized particles, opening new paths for applications in sensing and metrology."}

It was theoretically predicted that, for microspheres, electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients can simultaneously vanish by engineering the incident light, leading to the excitation of nonradiating hybrid optical anapoles. In this work, the experimental detection of hybrid optical anapoles in dielectric microspheres (TiO2) is reported using dual detection optical spectroscopy, developed to enable sequential measurement of forward and backward scattering under tightly_focused Gaussian beam (TFGB) illumination. The results show that the excitation of TiO2 microspheres (diameter, d approx. 1 um) under TFGB illumination leads to the appearance of scattering minima in both the forward and backward directions within specific wavelength ranges. These scattering minima are found to be due to vanishing electric and magnetic dipolar coefficients associated with hybrid optical anapoles. The ability to confine electromagnetic fields associated with hybrid optical anapoles can give rise to several novel optical phenomena and applications."}

In this study, we derive analytical expressions for optical forces and torques on micron_sized spherical particles illuminated by focused Laguerre_Gaussian (LG) beams, employing the well_defined helicity multipolar decomposition of electromagnetic fields and Mie theory. We developed a multifunctional program, Multipolar Optical Forces Toolbox, based on this theoretical framework. The program, available on GitHub, was used to generate optical trapping stability maps. These maps predict trap stability across a wide range of system parameters and serve as a practical tool for designing advanced optical trapping experiments. Our analysis reveals the important role of helicity p and orbital angular momentum l on the dynamics of particles trapped off_axis in LG beams and demonstrates the unique nature of the tangential torque. Our findings also highlight notable differences in longitudinal optical forces resulting from pure helicity modifications in Gaussian beams. Furthermore, we showcase the ability of LG beams to isolate Mie resonances, offering a novel approach to locate the spectral positions of the resonances of high multipolar modes. These insights deepen the understanding of helicity in LG optical traps and pave the way for the development of more advanced optical manipulation techniques."}
