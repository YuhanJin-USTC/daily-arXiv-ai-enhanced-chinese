Not many diagnostics are expected to be available in a reactor environment. Survivability, maintainability, and limited port space substantially restrict the number of FPP-relevant diagnostics. One remaining challenge is developing tools and devices to extract plasma state information necessary for controlling an FPP from a limited subset of diagnostics. This work is part of an overarching project to address this challenge. The specific diagnostic subset to be used in FPPs is still under debate. We take the approach of developing machine-learning-based tools for different significant plasma state parameters, using already known FPP-viable diagnostics. Previously we developed a plasma confinement mode classifier utilizing the Electron Cyclotron Emission (ECE) diagnostic. Here, we expand on this by developing a Profile Reflectometer (PR) based classifier with 97\\% test accuracy, and an ensemble model that combines the ECE and PR models into a single model, achieving 99\\% test accuracy."}

This work presents a detailed investigation of the effects of static magnetic islands on ITG instability, relevant to the ADITYA-U tokamak, using the Global Gyrokinetic Code in Cylindrical Coordinates (G2C3), a particle-in-cell (PIC) framework that employs a neural-network-assisted projection scheme. A two-phase simulation strategy is adopted. In the first phase, static magnetic islands with mode numbers (m, n) = (2, 1) and (3, 1) are introduced by perturbing the equilibrium magnetic flux functions. Particle dynamics within these modified topologies result in the flattening of plasma density profiles in the island regions, confirming island formation and its impact on the equilibrium profiles. In the second phase, the flattened profiles serve as new equilibria for linear electrostatic gyrokinetic simulations with adiabatic electrons, enabling the study of the modified ITG behavior. Magnetic islands significantly restructure the ITG mode, producing a spatial redistribution of potential fluctuations within and around the island region. Moreover, as the island width increases, the growth rates of different toroidal ITG modes converge, suggesting a universal stabilization trend. A comparison between the (2,1) and (3,1) islands indicates that higher-q islands lead to a more spatially extended ITG mode structure, reflecting the longer magnetic connection lengths and weaker curvature drive at outer flux surfaces. These results demonstrate the pivotal role of island-induced equilibrium modifications in determining ITG stability and mode structure in tokamak plasmas."}

Improving our understanding of this regime requires experimental data that can be directly compared with theoretical and numerical models over a broad range of conditions. In this work, a pulsed-power experiment is described in which thin metallic foils, confined within a sapphire cell, are Joule-heated to achieve the expanded warm dense matter regime. Designing such an experiment is challenging, as it requires simultaneously predicting the electrical response of the pulsed-power driver and the hydrodynamic evolution of the heated material. To tackle this challenge, a modeling framework has been developed that couples an electrical description of the pulsed-power system, including the driver, the switching stages and the load with a one-dimensional hydrodynamic code. This coupling allows the electrical energy deposition and the load thermodynamic evolution to be consistently linked through the material electrical conductivity. This approach takes advantage of the simplicity of a 1D geometry while retaining the essential physics and allowing to reproduce various measurements with good accuracy, such as expansion velocity, current and voltage. This numerical approach therefore constitutes a robust and efficient method for designing and optimizing future Warm Dense Matter experiments using pulsed-power facilities."}

The high-repetition rate enables systematic spatial and temporal scans of the plasma evolution using Doppler spectroscopy, as well as measurements of the magnetic field, electrostatic field, and self-emission of both debris and ambient ions using filtered imaging. We observe the self-focusing of the laser-produced plasma and the formation of a secondary diamagnetic cavity associated with a blob composed of background ions. Doppler spectroscopy reveals the transverse velocity distribution of the background ions, providing direct evidence of ion energization via Larmor coupling. The systematic spatial and temporal scans enabled by the high-repetition rate experiment allow for a detailed characterization of the ion dynamics.

Using the same set of laser beams as required for the initial Doppler laser cooling operation, we detune the laser frequencies to produce a narrow two-photon dark resonance. The process achieves a 1/e cooling time constant of 108(8) $μ$s, ultimately reducing the mean thermal axial mode occupation from 72(23) to 1.5(3) in 800 $μ$s as measured by resonantly probing an electric quadrupole transition near 729 nm. A parametric drive is applied to the trap electrodes which coherently exchanges the axial mode occupation with that of each radial mode, allowing for three-dimensional sub-Doppler cooling using only the axially-propagating laser beams. This sub-Doppler cooling is achieved for an axial oscillation frequency of $ω_z = 2π~\\times~$221 kHz, which places the motion well outside of the Lamb Dicke confinement regime at the Doppler laser cooling limit. Our measured cooling rate and final mode occupation are in good agreement with a semiclassical model which combines a Lindblad master equation solution for ion-photon interactions with classical harmonic oscillator motion of the trapped ion."}

The method combines classical Jacobi-Richardson iterations with data-driven corrections to refine numerical solutions while preserving the underlying topological and metric structure. NHCS employs a two-phase training strategy. In the first phase, DEC operators are learned through relative residual minimization from data. In the second phase, these operators are integrated into the iterative solver, and training targets the improvement of convergence through learned corrective updates that remain effective even for inaccurate intermediate solutions. This staggered training enables stable, progressive refinement while maintaining the structure-preserving properties of DEC discretizations. To improve multiscale adaptivity, NHCS introduces a convolutional neural network-based correction term capable of capturing fine-scale solution features via localized updates informed by global context, improving scalability over mesh component-wise neural approaches. Moreover, the proposed framework substantially reduces computational cost by avoiding Newton-Raphson-based training and the associated Jacobian evaluations of parameterized operators. The resulting solver achieves improved efficiency, robustness, and accuracy without compromising numerical stability."}

In this paper, we present a means to reduce electron beam energy spread after emission to the level of a few 10s of meV rms using femtosecond photoemission and an interaction with laser-derived single- to few-cycle terahertz (THz) radiation. We show analytically and in particle tracking simulations that this interaction can remove energy spread stored in both the transverse and longitudinal degrees of freedom. We analytically formulate the limit of energy spread that this technique can achieve, and map the non-ideal affects arising at high frequencies. The interaction is mediated by the beam's passage through a mirror which is reflective to terahertz radiation but allows transmission of the majority of the electron beam (e.g. a wire mesh). This method then only requires beam current losses of a few tens of percent, far smaller than what is achieved in prism and slit-based electron monochromators."}

These materials also undergo structural phase transitions, with phase boundaries separating different phases and the kinetics of the phase boundaries governed by the magnetic field and the mechanical stresses. There is a multiplicity of other materials revealing similar phenomena, e.g. magnetic perovskites. To model the propagation of the phase boundaries in deformable magnetic materials at the continuum scale, three ingredients are required: a set of governing equations for the bulk behaviour with coupled magnetic and mechanical degrees of freedom, a dependency of the phase boundary velocity on the governing factors, and a reliable computational method. The expression for the phase boundary velocity is usually obtained within the continuum thermodynamics setting, where the entropy production due to phase boundary propagation is derived, which gives a thermodynamic driving force for the phase boundary kinetics. For deformable ferromagnets, all three elements (bulk behaviour, interface kinetics, and computational approaches) have been explored, but under a number of limitations. The present paper focuses on the derivation of the thermodynamic driving force for transformation fronts in a general magneto-mechanical setting, adapts the cut-finite-element method for transformation fronts in magneto-mechanics, which allows for an exceptionally efficient handling of the propagating interfaces, without modifying the finite-element mesh, and applies the developments to qualitative modelling of magneto-mechanics of magnetic shape-memory alloys."}

The theory is developed within the framework of the Taylor--Melcher leaky dielectric model, and builds on previous work by retaining surface charge convection in the charge conservation equation. Solving the problem in three dimensions and retaining charge convection allows us to capture the transition to Quincke rotation, a symmetry breaking instability wherein a drop begins rotating at a steady angular velocity when the applied electric field strength exceeds a critical value. We derive a system of coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations for the drop shape, dipole moment, and surfactant distribution, which we solve numerically. We discuss the combined effects of charge convection and surfactant in the Taylor regime -- in which the field strength is too weak to induce Quincke rotation and the drop adopts an axisymmetric spheroidal shape. In the Quincke regime, we find that the presence of a weakly-diffusing surfactant results in a lower critical electric field than that for a drop with uniform surfactant coverage. Varying the elasticity number, which quantifies the variation of the surface tension as a function of the surfactant concentration, can either increase or decrease the critical field strength depending on the diffusivity of the surfactant. Additionally, we find that the experimentally observed hysteresis in the angular velocity of the drop can disappear when surfactant diffusion is sufficiently weak."}

The actuation is achieved using optical tweezers. The device integrates a microgear transmission system with an optically actuated part, enabling light-controlled micromachines. When illuminated by a highly focused laser source, the first gear generates rotational torque within the gear assembly, converting optical energy into directional mechanical work that can be transmitted to the coupled gear. We demonstrate the fabrication of micromachines using two-photon polymerization (2PP) laser writing, enabling the fabrication of spur gear trains and bevel gears that can produce out-of-plane rotations, which is not achievable with traditional micromachining fabrication techniques. The micromachines are composed of a single gear or a train of two or three gears without any unwanted adhesion between the components, leading to functioning systems. Experimentally, the fabricated micromachines were actuated using optical tweezers, demonstrating continuous gear rotation, effective motion transmission in gear trains, out-of-plane rotations, and the ability to amplify velocity or torque.

Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics."}

In this work, we first evaluate the performance of several representative volume-corrected phase-field models in direct numerical simulations of droplet-laden homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Our results reveal that, at sufficiently high Weber numbers, none of the existing models provides satisfactory droplet-volume preservation. To address this limitation, we then propose a simple yet effective modification of the conservataive Allen-Cahn equation by incorporating a curvature-dependent counter-diffusion correction.

The difference between purely pulsed and hybrid excitation regimes points to the influence of pulse-to-pulse timing fluctuations. To elucidate this effect, we perform Langevin-based simulations that reproduce the experimentally observed broadening and confirm that time jitter, originating from spontaneous-emission noise near threshold, dominates the temporal dispersion.

This decomposition reveals that an optimal bubble curvature emerges only when the tube is submerged: the optimality is absent for non-submerged configurations, where the jet speed increases monotonically with bubble depth. Experiments confirm this non-monotonicity and quantitatively support the predicted shift of the optimal geometry with submersion depth."}

However, many previous studies adopted correlation analysis to reveal the causal map between turbulent motions and TSD generation, an approach that is potentially risky as correlation does not necessarily imply causation. In this study, a novel causal inference method called Liang-Kleeman information flow (LKIF) is utilized for the first time to identify the velocity-induced causal structures related to TSD generation in a turbulent channel flow. The statistical properties of the causal structures are comprehensively investigated. The positive and negative causal structures, defined by their signs and respectively associated with an increase and decrease in TSD information entropy, promote and suppress the generation of extreme TSD. Particularly, we find that the underlying physics of causal structures is essentially associated with the processes of streamwise streaks and rolls approaching or receding from the extreme events. Results indicate that the physics-informed LKIF framework can reveal a more explicit and interpretable causal relationship than correlation analysis."}

While optical systems provide a controlled setting for studying these phenomena, achieving deterministic control over their generation remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to induce and precisely modulate extreme events in a semiconductor VCSEL using polarization-controlled optical feedback. By integrating a $λ$/2-waveplate into a polarization-selective external cavity, we regulate the nonlinear interaction between TE and TM modes. This setup triggers high-intensity, heavy-tailed fluctuations in the TM mode, exhibiting clear signatures of extreme events. We show that these events arise from deterministic energy exchange between modes, as evidenced by strong bipolar correlations and long-range temporal memory. The waveplate angle serves as an effective external parameter, enabling non-monotonic tuning of the event rate, intensity, and temporal clustering. Our study establish a platform for exploring extreme events in dissipative systems, with implications for nonlinear photonics and optical technologies."}

We find that the assemblies can be effectively rotated in a two-dimensional optical trap with orbital frequencies of up to 5 Hz. We use video tracking to explore the Brownian dynamics of such a trapping arrangement and look at the impact of orientation stability on measurements of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with an applied weak external magnetic field.

This suppression in radiative heat transfer is directly correlated with mode localization, as revealed by the mode decomposition of the transmission coefficient, which serves as evidence of Anderson localization. Furthermore, we elucidate the dependence of radiative thermal conductance reduction on interparticle spacing and material damping rates, uncovering the interplay between intrinsic Ohmic losses, mode localization, and long-range many-body interactions. Our findings advance the understanding of wave-mediated thermal transport in disordered photonic structures and suggest strategies for tailoring nanoscale heat management via engineered disorder."}

Inspired by sand-grain roughness experiments performed by Hollis (2017), we perform the first direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a blunt cylinder in Mach 6 cross-flow with roughness elements distributed along the entire surface. Such simulations aimed to uncover the precise means by which laminar-turbulent transition occurs given the limited measurements attainable from experiments and non-existent high-fidelity simulations. Element heights were held fixed at approximately 35% boundary layer thickness, while the relative phasing between streamwise rows was varied. All configurations exhibited convective instabilities driving the transition process, with the mode type being set by the roughness configuration. A fundamental sinuous streak mode dominated the aligned roughness element case, whereas both the staggered and randomly phased cases saw 2D T-S waves dominating. These instability waves, when grown to sufficient amplitude, triggered the steady streaks seeded by the underlying roughness pattern to begin forming hairpin vortices and breakdown occurred soon thereafter. The roughness arrangement was found to dramatically influence the degree to which the waves were destabilised, as well as the strength of the underlying steady streaks, thereby combining to dictate the position along the surface where LTT occurred. Finally, exogeneous forcing was not required for the T-S dominated cases as the acoustics generated by the turbulence in the subsonic flow excited T-S waves on the other side - a feedback mechanism hitherto unknown."}

At larger heights, diffracted fields from the square edges dominate and convert the lattice into a Bloch-type configuration. Over a range of intermediate heights, crossover between the evanescent SPP and edge diffraction gives rise to rich rapid topology evolutions. The switching is accompanied by nucleation of off-boundary vortex-anti vortex pairs in the in-plane spin phase, producing height-dependent fractional site charges. Our findings are analytically formulated by linear superposition of SPPs in the plasmonic regime and Stratton-Chu model in diffraction regime and confirmed via full-wave finite-difference time-domain simulations."}

The stall cell width is of the order of the chord length and increases linearly with the angle of attack, with a weak dependence on the Reynolds number. Its dynamics at Reynolds numbers larger than 1 Million is dominated by a coherent motion in the spanwise direction with a characteristic velocity of order tenth of the freestream velocity. The motion can be decomposed into a large-scale, low-frequency sweep with a Strouhal number equal to 0.001 combined with faster, smaller-scale oscillations. The coherence of the stall cell makes it possible to track global dynamics from local measurements."}

However, their design remains constrained by intuitive, iterative methods that lack flexibility, while also facing challenges in multi-objective optimization. Here, we introduce a deep learning-enabled inverse-design framework that overcomes these limitations through a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN). The main contribution of this work is a dual-channel image encoding scheme that jointly represents the geometry and thickness of a Si$_3$N$_4$ meta-layer, facilitating the network to learn the distribution of viable structures for a target optical response. This approach naturally solves the inherent ``one-to-many'' design issue, giving a diverse portfolio of functional candidates from a single input spectrum. The designed absorbers achieve exceptional spectral fidelity, with resonance peak errors below 5 nm, a mean squared error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, and the capacity to produce over 10 distinct, high-performance designs per target. Furthermore, we demonstrate the model's robustness under oblique illumination, showing that it can be efficiently fine-tuned to maintain spectral accuracy across incidence angles from $10^\\circ$ to $40^\\circ$ by transfer learning, thus extending its practical utility to non-normal operating conditions. Full-wave simulations confirm that the generated geometries support a hybrid plasmonic-dielectric resonance, leading to near-perfect absorption and strong near-field enhancement. Our study provides a robust, physics-aware design paradigm that moves beyond conventional parametric optimization. The introduced framework establishes a versatile platform for the on-demand inverse design of advanced photonic devices for sensing, spectroscopy, and optical signal processing."}

For an open elliptical microcavity in the strong-interaction A.C. regime, we find a distinctive sector-resolved response: amplitude statistics tighten while phase statistics broaden maximally at the mixing point, and conditioning reveals strong amplitude-phase dependence. By introducing a coarse position label and the associated co-information, we further show that the enhancement of global amplitude-phase coupling is strongly shaped by spatial heterogeneity across the cavity."}

Yet enforcing foundry design rules during inverse design remains a major challenge, as optimized devices frequently violate constraints on minimum feature size and spacing. Existing fabrication-constrained approaches typically rely on penalty terms, projection filters, or heuristic binarization schedules, which restrict the accessible design space, require extensive hyperparameter tuning, and often fail to guarantee compliance throughout the optimization trajectory. Here, we introduce a framework for nanophotonic inverse design with intrinsic enforcement of design rules through a generative reparameterization of the design space, restricting optimization to a learned manifold of DRC-compliant geometries. We validate this paradigm by designing representative silicon photonic components including broadband power splitters, spectral duplexers, and mode converters operating across the 1,500-1,600 nm band for both electron-beam lithography and photolithography platforms. Across all devices, the manifold-based formulation reaches state-of-the-art performance metrics with over a 5-fold reduction in computational cost compared to pixel-based representations, while ensuring fabrication-compatible geometries throughout the entire design process. By treating fabrication constraints as a fundamental property of the design representation rather than an external penalty, this work establishes a direct pathway toward broadly applicable, platform-agnostic, and intrinsically DRC-compliant nanophotonics."}

Here, we address these issues experimentally by resolving the trajectory-dependent temporal structure of liquid HHG. By optimizing the laser focusing geometry, we achieve clear spatial discrimination of short- and long-trajectory contributions, providing direct evidence for the existence of multiple quantum trajectories in liquids. Using a phase-controlled two-color driving field, we independently retrieve the attochirp associated with each trajectory and demonstrate opposite energy-time correlations for short and long trajectories, establishing a trajectory-resolved energy-time mapping in liquid HHG. All observations are well reproduced by semiclassical recollision simulations. These results place liquid HHG on the same conceptual footing as gas- and solid-phase HHG and establish a robust foundation for attosecond-resolved spectroscopy of ultrafast electronic and chemical dynamics in liquid environments."}

In this work, we propose a synthetic-dimensional higher-order topological insulator by engineering the flexural bands of elastic metamaterials, featuring highly localized topological hinge states in the bulk bands. This topological hinge mode stems from the nonzero combination of the bulk polarization and the Chern number in the synthetic-dimensional band structure, thus giving rise to a strong elastic-to-electric energy conversion at the corner of the phononic plate. Through numerical simulations and experimental validations, straightforward evidence of the localized modes with robust protection and consequent abilities in activating the light-emitting diodes (LEDs) array have been demonstrated.
