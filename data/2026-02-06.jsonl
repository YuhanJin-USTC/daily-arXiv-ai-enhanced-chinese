In Z-pinch geometry, we show that, like the edge pedestal in tokamak devices, this transport barrier -- which we call the ``MHD pedestal'' -- is metastable, i.e., unstable to finite-amplitude displacements of flux tubes. We simulate the slow formation of an MHD pedestal in a heated and sheared Z-pinch, which collapses on reaching a critical height, expelling an order-unity fraction of the confined thermal energy. The MHD pedestal then rebuilds and the process repeats, in a manner analogous to the ELM cycle seen in fusion experiments. We show that the available energy of the metastable equilibrium, and the most energetically favorable amount of ejected plasma, can be calculated from first principles via combinatorial optimization of flux-tube interchanges."}

Despite intense efforts, chip-integrated OFCs remain laboratory-bound, unable to fulfill their promise of compact and cost-effective deployment. While improvement in fabrication and integration are important, a conceptual limitation has fundamentally stymied progress: on-chip OFC architectures have aimed to miniaturize their table-top counterparts and relied on cascading outward from (i.e., spectrally broadening) a single pump. In integrated platforms, this approach does not readily allow for the generation of strong and low-noise octave-spaced signals that are crucially needed for robust zero-frequency offset detection. Here, we overcome this limitation via an architectural inversion where an optical microcomb forms by filling the spectrum between two octave-separated pump lasers. The two pumps generate a parametrically driven cavity soliton (PDCS) in an integrated $χ^{(3)}$ resonator, which robustly self-aligns to (i.e., synchronizes with) the pump lasers across multiple foundry-fabricated devices and operating configurations. This produces a single octave-spanning comb extending from telecom to visible wavelengths, whose zero-frequency offset is completely defined by the two harmonically-related pump lasers, and can therefore be reliably detected and stabilized. We showcase our platform's capabilities by executing all of the three core tasks of OFC metrology: optical frequency synthesis, low-noise millimeter-wave generation, and integrated optical clock readout, using the same self-aligned microcomb with only its input locks changed."}

Four monodisperse suspensions of particles with identical diameter and volume fraction $10^{-3}$ are considered, while the particle-to-fluid density ratio varies between $100$ and $1500$ and the mass fraction between $0.1$ and $0.6$. As particle inertia increases, the energy spectrum departs from the canonical Kolmogorov $κ^{-5/3}$ scaling and approaches a peculiar regime with $κ^{-1}$. In this limit, the nonlinear energy transfer is strongly suppressed and the kinetic energy balance is dominated by the fluid-solid interaction and the viscous dissipation. Consistently, the second-order structure function shows logarithmic scaling at separations larger than the particle diameter, indicating velocity decorrelation. Increasing particle inertia promotes axial strain and vortex compression in the vicinity of the particles and enhances the particle-fluid relative velocity. Particle clustering weakens as the density ratio and the Stokes number increase, with the volume and the population of the clusters decreasing when inertia is enhanced. Nevertheless, when clustering occurs, particles preferentially sample regions of high strain and low vorticity, for all the values of the density ratio and the mass fraction considered here."}

While asymmetric IR transmission at a specific incidence angle -- typically normal incidence -- is often emphasized, we show that such single-angle asymmetry is neither sufficient nor predictive of practical cooling performance. In this work, we demonstrate that effective non-contact PRC requires angularly distributed asymmetric IR transparency evaluated through hemispherical integration over emission directions, rather than asymmetry at a single incidence angle. To quantify this effect, an angle-resolved full-wave electromagnetic (EM) model with Bloch periodic boundary conditions and Floquet mode decomposition is employed to compute wavelength- and angle-dependent bidirectional reflection and transmission of periodic PRC structures. The resulting EM response is coupled to an energy-balance-based thermal model to predict the transient temperature evolution of the cooling object. By comparing models that account for the full angular distribution with normal-incidence-only approximations, we show that pronounced asymmetric transmission at normal incidence is generally not preserved at oblique angles. As a result, angular integration yields only marginal cooling or may even result in net heating, whereas normal-incidence-based models can substantially overestimate cooling performance. These results establish angularly distributed asymmetric transparency as a key EM design principle for IR-transparent PRC and wide-angle asymmetric metasurfaces."}

We introduce a covariant Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition (CHHD) with respect to an effective acoustic metric, which identifies the irrotational (potential) component with the exact part of the metric-dual velocity one-form. Thermal refraction and shock-induced bending are absorbed into the induced curvature, ensuring that such geometric variations are not misidentified as physical vorticity. For canonical entropy-spot refraction and normal-shock discontinuities, Euclidean Helmholtz--Hodge and momentum-potential post-processing produce significant leakage in the refracting/discontinuous region, whereas the covariant splitting remains at the numerical noise floor (typically $\\lesssim 10^{-12}$) throughout the domain, demonstrating robustness even at the sonic horizon, where the Euclidean metric singularity typically causes catastrophic error amplification. This geometric framework for velocity fields resolves the ambiguity of irrotational motion in inhomogeneous media and establishes a necessary foundation for future generalizations to full thermodynamic state vectors."}

We perform two complementary analyses: (1) comparing relativistic corrections computed at both the Hartree-Fock (HF) and coupled cluster CCSD(T) levels to assess how correlation influences the magnitude of relativistic corrections, and (2) comparing correlation corrections computed within both non-relativistic and relativistic frameworks to determine how relativity influences the magnitude of correlation corrections.\n  Our results reveal a striking non-linear relationship between these two effects. Specifically, the combined effect of relativity and correlation on ionization energy does not equal the sum of their individual contributions. This non-additivity indicates that relativistic and correlation effects are not independent; they interact in complex ways that depend on the atomic system. We find that for some atoms, the two effects enhance each other, while for others they partially cancel. Moreover, the order in which one may add \"separate\" effects also counts, in that adding \"pure\" relativistic effects to the remaining outcome (including correlation) would give a different result than when adding \"pure\" correlation effects to the remaining outcome (including relativity).\n  These findings demonstrate that relativistic and correlation effects are inherently non-additive, reflecting the non-linearity of the quantum many-body problem. Accurate computational predictions of ionization energies in heavy-element systems thus require simultaneous treatment of both effects rather than treating them as independent contributions."}

However, as a collision kernel, it dose not guarantee the entrinsic detailed balance and is not integrable. In this work, the Pullin equation, which possesses an integrable collision kernel and satisfies the detailed balance constraint, is adopted as an extended Boltzmann equation for the theoretical analysis of near-continuum relaxation mechanisms. For clarity, only the translational and rotational degrees are considered in this work. Explicit analytical expressions for the temporal relaxation of macroscopic variables, including the stress force, (translational/rotational) temperature and heat flux, are obtained at the first time. This is achieved by approximating the distribution function in mixed Hermite and Laguerre for rotation and computing the collision operator moments, enabling a direct description of macroscopic non-equilibrium evolution. Base on the same elementary moment (integral) of collision operator, the macroscopic transport coefficients is found in Chapman-Enskog framework. The long-standing speculation, that thermal conduction coefficient should be depended on the degrees of thermal non-equilibrium, is rigorously confirmed and evaluated. When thermal equilibrium is enforced, the present thermal conduction coefficients can be degenerated to the famous results of Mason and Monchick. Given the correct relaxation rate, a Rykov-type novel relaxation model for Pullin equation is proposed. It can recover the interaction of transaltional and rotatioanl heat fluxes in relaxation process, which is ignored in the widely used Rykov equation. Finally, the precision of this new Rykov-type equation is examined using a series of benchmark test cases."}

Orthogonal projections are a key ingredient and ensure that the non-residual, term-by-term structure induces dissipation through dynamic subscales suitable for turbulent simulations.

In this case, the pulse train can be characterized statistically, by a base pulse and a metric that quantifies the instabilities. Here, we demonstrate that the amplitude swing technique is sensitive to instabilities, which manifest as two distinct imprints on the measurement. First, we analyze the terms that compose the amplitude swing signal. Then, we study two parameters to quantify the instabilities, related to a shift in the minima of the trace marginal, and to the filling of the trace minima zones, respectively.

Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts."}

A photonic crystal nanocavity is employed for coupling QD emission into a GaAs waveguide, which efficiently transfers photons to a SiN waveguide at the crossover section.

Submitted to Journal of Fluid Mechanics", "summary": "We investigate the effect of rotor velocity induction on the distribution of particles impinging on rotor blades and model the delayed response of a particle to the rotor-induced velocity field. We consider as reference a wind turbine rotor and a small-scale propeller in axial flow conditions. We first show that the classical 2D modeling of the multi-phase flow can generate a systematic error with respect to the 3D solution. We consider two limiting cases: particles in equilibrium with the rotor-induced velocity field, where the carrier phase is computed using the section's aerodynamic velocity vector, and induction-independent particles, where the geometric velocity vector is used. The 3D solution differs from the two limiting cases when particles are in partial equilibrium with the induced velocity. We introduce an induction Stokes number $\\mathit{Stk}_\\text{ind}$ and identify a transition regime between the two limiting solutions for $0.1 \\lesssim \\mathit{Stk}_\\text{ind} \\lesssim 10$. Then, we present a simple 1D delay model to evaluate the induced component of the particle velocity at the rotor disk as a function $\\mathit{Stk}_\\text{ind}$. We validate the model by showing that it allows capturing the transition regime in 2D simulations. The model only requires knowledge of the aerodynamic and geometric velocity vectors, i.e., of the axial and tangential induction factors."}

This feature is intrinsic to this type of interferometer as correlated photons of vastly different frequencies propagate through a dispersive nonlinear crystal; consequently, the dispersion arises from the source itself. The resulting GVD degrades the axial point-spread function (PSF) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) with undetected photons; and physical compensation is less straightforward, in particular for non-degenerate broadband regimes due to the limited number of suitable materials. In this contribution, we analyze dispersion in bulk nonlinear interferometry and describe its implications for OCT imaging. Aspects of hardware compensation are addressed, and a novel empirical numerical method of compensation is proposed. The approach is based on the extraction of the phase component directly from the time-domain modality (high precision linearized quantum Fourier transform infrared spectrometer) and its injection into the mid-IR spectral-domain OCT signals (central wavelength of around 3770 nm) before the Fourier transform. The proposed method is compared with an alternative numerical technique. The results demonstrate a 2.2-fold improvement in axial resolution and outperform the alternative correction method in overall imaging performance."}

This study proposes a novel technique for engineering the field of view of an optical system without compromising the magnification. In the proposed method, an object response pattern is recorded on a camera by introducing a coded phase mask (CPM) in the imaging system. The coded phase mask is a multiplexing of N distinct scattering phases, where N-1 represents the number of isolated object areas to be brought within the field of view. Each scattering phase yields a point spread function of a unique sparse dot pattern on the camera. With the introduction of a coded phase mask, the objects' images are brought within the region of the camera sensor, which, without the CPM, would have remained outside the inherent field of view of the system. To reconstruct the original object plane with N objects at their respective locations, the zero-padded object response pattern is deconvolved with the system's zero-padded and shifted point spread function. A simulation study followed by experimental results for N = 2 and N = 3 is presented in this article."}

Here we demonstrate a mechanically reconfigurable slow-light delay line based on a surface nanoscale axial photonics (SNAP) microresonator dynamically induced by controlled bending of a silica optical fiber. A localized nanoscale cutoff-wavelength dip, introduced by CO2-laser annealing, provides a reflective boundary, while fiber bending generates a smooth axial potential whose shape is continuously tunable via loop curvature. By adjusting the bending radius, the induced SNAP microresonator evolves from a nearly linear to an approximately semiparabolic axial profile, enabling a controlled transition from dispersive to nearly dispersionless delay. Using a transverse microfiber coupler operated at the impedance-matching condition, we experimentally demonstrate continuous delay tuning from 2 ns to 0.5 ns within a 10 GHz bandwidth in an approximately 2 mm long fiber segment, with insertion loss below 6 dB. The results confirm that mechanically induced SNAP microresonators provide a compact, robust, and reconfigurable platform for dispersion-engineered optical delay lines, with direct relevance to photonic beamforming, frequency-comb stabilization, and neuromorphic photonic signal processing."}

This work proposes a compact passive nonlinear photonic core based on a Side-Coupled Integrated Spaced Sequence of Resonators (SCISSOR) made of three nominally equal microrings and investigate its computing capabilities. Its nonlinearities and internal feedback enable analogue, spiking, and bistable responses that are accessed by tuning the injection power and wavelength. Implemented as a single nonlinear node in a time-multiplexed reservoir computing, the SCISSOR achieves error-free classification on the Iris dataset and accuracies above 97% on the Sonar task, using both analogue and digital reservoir representations with 150 virtual nodes. In the digital scheme, spiking dynamics naturally generate sparse reservoir states, enabling efficient classification even with a single spike. Intriguingly, optimal operating points are at the boundaries where sharp transitions in dynamical complexity and/or output power occur. In these points, the SCISSOR supports high task-performance, opening novel strategies for future on-chip training. Spiking and thermal bistabilities also participate to enhance the computational performance at low injected powers below 4 mW. These results suggest optical coupled microring resonators as effective building blocks for future edge computing and neuromorphic photonic systems."}

However, the high power requirement remains a major obstacle to the widespread use of OPAs. Integrated OPAs can in principle improve the pump efficiency with tight mode confinement; however, challenges associated with propagation loss, limited nonlinearity, and susceptibility to nanoscale fabrication imperfections prevent them from competing with conventional bulk and fiber-based OPAs. Here, we demonstrate a highly efficient integrated OPAs with continuous-wave net gain. The pump efficiency is improved by over one order of magnitude. Phase-sensitive gain of 23.5 dB is demonstrated, significantly exceeding previous integrated OPAs, using only 110 mW pump power and no cavity enhancement. This is achieved with parametric down-conversion in thin-film lithium niobate waveguides using the adapted poling technique to maintain the coherence of nonlinear interactions. Moreover, the high parametric gain exceeds fibre-chip-fibre losses, leading to appreciable net gain up to 10 dB. The 3 dB bandwidth is approximately 120 nm, covering telecommunication S-, C-, and Lbands. Quantum-limited noise performance is confirmed through the measurement of output field fluctuation below the classical limit. We further demonstrate that signalto-noise ratio in noisy optical communications can be increased by leveraging this efficient integrated OPA. Our work marks a significant step towards ideal optical amplifiers with strong amplification, high efficiency, quantum-limited noise, large bandwidth, and continuous-wave operation, unlocking new possibilities for next-generation photonic information processing systems."}
